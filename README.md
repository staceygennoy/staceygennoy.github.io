#Cepheus

Cepheus is a sample project using some of the latest web technologies.

- Grunt
- Bower
- SaSS
- BootStrap
- JQuery

## Building
You may clone and use this as a starting point for a web project using these technologies.

To build Cepheus you will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) installed.

- Clone the repository
- Inside the root `/cepheus` directory run `npm run build` to install the necessary dependencies and build Cepheus

The built version of Cepheus will be placed in the `dist/` subdirectory.

You may then use 'grunt' to build the project from then on.
