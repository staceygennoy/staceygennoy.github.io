# Portfolio

## My personal portfolio project: staceygennoy.com

1. Make changes locally on computer in the src directory.
1. Run grunt to build the project (in terminal type "npm start" within the root directory)
1. [Test locally](http://0.0.0.0:9002)
1. When happy with changes:
   1. Use terminal to navigate to the root (portfolio folder, where is everything is) directory.
   1. Make sure on the "development" branch
   1. Terminal: Git add, git commit, git push (which pushes all files to the development branch), possibly pull if making updates to readme.
1. Use terminal to navigate to the dist directory (probably now on the "master" branch)
1. Terminal: Git add, git commit, git push (which pushes dist files to GitHub live)

(Command K, then V to show preview (not command V))
